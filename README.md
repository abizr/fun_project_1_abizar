## Quiz Content Overview

The quiz consists of a carefully curated set of questions focusing on
Indonesian facts and myths. Each question presents a statement, and the


user must decide whether it is a Fakta (Fact) or Mitos (Myth). The
questions cover a variety of topics, including:

```
‚óè Historical landmarks and their origins (e.g., Candi Borobudur)
```
```
‚óè Unique flora and fauna native to Indonesia (e.g., Rafflesia arnoldii)
```
```
‚óè Natural disasters and their historical impact (e.g., Gunung
Krakatau eruption)
```
```
‚óè Cultural practices and traditions (e.g., eating habits)
```
```
‚óè Traditional arts and performances (e.g., Wayang kulit)
```
Each question is accompanied by two answer choices, and after
submission, the app provides immediate feedback explaining why the
answer is correct or incorrect. This educational approach helps users
learn interesting facts while dispelling common myths.

## Scoring System

The scoring mechanism is designed to be simple yet effective in
evaluating the user's knowledge. Here‚Äôs how it works:

```
‚óè Each correct answer awards one point.
```
```
‚óè Incorrect answers do not penalize the user but do not add to the
score.
```
```
‚óè The total score is the sum of all correct answers out of the total
number of questions.
```
After submitting the quiz, users receive a detailed breakdown of their
performance, including:

```
‚óè Total score displayed as ‚ÄúX out of Y‚Äù where X is the number of
correct answers and Y is the total questions.
```
```
‚óè Individual feedback for each question, highlighting the correct
answer and providing informative messages to reinforce learning.
```
This scoring system encourages users to aim for accuracy while
providing constructive feedback to improve their understanding.

## Profession Suggestions

To add a fun and personalized touch, the app suggests a profession or
role based on the user‚Äôs quiz score. This feature is designed to motivate


users and give them a playful insight into how their knowledge might
align with certain cultural or academic interests.

The profession suggestions are categorized as follows:

```
‚óè Perfect Score (All Correct Answers):
Ahli Budaya Indonesia (Indonesian Culture Expert) ‚Äî You have an
excellent grasp of Indonesian facts and myths, making you a great
candidate for cultural research or education.
```
```
‚óè High Score (70% or More Correct):
Peneliti Sejarah (History Researcher) ‚Äî Your knowledge is strong,
and you have the potential to delve deeper into historical studies.
```
```
‚óè Moderate Score (40% to 69% Correct):
Penggemar Budaya (Culture Enthusiast) ‚Äî You have a good
foundation and a keen interest in Indonesian culture.
```
```
‚óè Low Score (Below 40%):
Pemula yang Ingin Belajar (Beginner Eager to Learn) ‚Äî Everyone
starts somewhere! Keep exploring and learning more about
Indonesia.
```
This feature not only adds an element of gamification but also

Understanding the internal structure of the Mini Quiz App can help you
customize and extend it effectively. Below is a breakdown of the key
components and how they interact within the Streamlit framework.


### 1. Questions Dictionary

At the heart of the app lies a Python dictionary named questions. This
dictionary organizes all quiz content in a structured manner. Each key is
a string representing a quiz question, and its value is another dictionary
containing:

```
‚óè choices : A list of possible answers, typically ["Fakta", "Mitos"].
```
```
‚óè correct : The correct answer string.
```
```
‚óè correct_msg : A message displayed when the user selects the
correct answer, providing additional context or explanation.
```
```
‚óè incorrect_msg : A message shown when the user selects an
incorrect answer, clarifying the misconception.
```
This design allows for easy addition, removal, or modification of
questions without altering the core logic of the app.

### 2. User Interface Components

The app leverages Streamlit‚Äôs interactive widgets to create a seamless
user experience:

```
‚óè Radio Buttons : For each question, radio buttons allow users to
select one answer from the provided choices. Each radio button
group is assigned a unique key to maintain state across
interactions.
```
```
‚óè Buttons : A "Lihat Hasil" (View Results) button triggers the
evaluation of answers and displays the results.
```
```
‚óè Text and Headers : Clear headings and descriptive text guide
users through the quiz process.
```
Streamlit‚Äôs session state is used extensively to store user selections and
scores, ensuring that data persists as users interact with the app.

### 3. Scoring and Feedback Logic

When the user submits their answers, the app compares each selected
answer against the correct one stored in the questions dictionary. The
scoring logic is straightforward:

```
‚óè Increment the score by one for each correct answer.
```
```
‚óè No penalty for incorrect answers.
```
After scoring, the app displays:

```
‚óè The total score.
```

```
‚óè Detailed feedback for each question, highlighting correct and
incorrect responses with appropriate messages.
```
```
‚óè A profession suggestion based on the score.
```
This immediate feedback loop enhances learning by reinforcing correct
knowledge and correcting misunderstandings.

### 4. Profession Suggestion Mechanism

The profession suggestion is a creative feature that maps the user‚Äôs quiz
performance to a hypothetical role or title. This mapping is based on
score thresholds and is designed to motivate users by associating their
knowledge level with culturally relevant professions.

The logic is simple but effective:

```
‚óè Perfect scores receive the highest accolade.
```
```
‚óè High scores suggest research-oriented roles.
```
```
‚óè Moderate scores indicate enthusiasm and interest.
```
```
‚óè Lower scores encourage continued learning.
```
This gamification element adds personality and engagement to the quiz
experience.

## Troubleshooting and Common Issues

While the Mini Quiz App is designed to be robust and user-friendly, you
may encounter some common issues during installation or usage. Here

Add competitive elements by displaying leaderboards or enabling users
to share their results on social media platforms, encouraging community
engagement.

### Localization and Language Support


Expand the app‚Äôs reach by supporting multiple languages. Use
translation files or libraries to switch quiz content dynamically based on
user preferences.

## Example Code Snippet for Adding a New Question

To illustrate how to add a new question, here is a sample snippet you can
insert into the questions dictionary:

"Pulau Komodo adalah habitat asli dari komodo, kadal terbesar di
dunia.": { "choices": ["Fakta", "Mitos"], "correct": "Fakta",
"correct_msg": "Benar! Pulau Komodo memang merupakan habitat asli
komodo.", "incorrect_msg": "Salah! Komodo terbesar di dunia hidup di
Pulau Komodo." }

This snippet adds a question about Komodo Island and its famous
inhabitants, complete with answer choices and feedback messages.
